Top Gear Code Off
================= 

Top Geat Code Off is an introductory computer programming course for children aged between 12 and 16 years.   The course introduces children to high level object orientated programming concepts and techniques, then goes on to put those concepts and knowlesge into practice, through the practical programming of a small robot car.  The course should last around 2 hours, by the end of which the children should have experience building, compiling and running a software application as well as highlighting how computer programming can become present and useful in the real world. 

Objective
----------
The goal of the course is to persuade more children into taking up computer programming either as part of academic studies or as a pass time.


Overview
----------
The course will consist of 3 sections

1. An introduction to object orientated concepts and a very brief introduction to C++ programming language: 30 minutes.
  * Real world vs OOP
  * Fields and Types
  * Operations
  * Control Flow
  * Method Invocations

2. A series of problem solving challenges using the robot car: 45 mins
The group will be split into teams of 4-5.  They will be given a worksheet to complete which will take them from very basic operations to being able to make the car perform several manuevrers

3. Top Gear Code Off Challenge: 1hr 15min
The teams will take part in a competition in which the robot car should be programmed to complete a circuit of the Top Gear Code Off track.  The team completing the track in the fastest time winning.
